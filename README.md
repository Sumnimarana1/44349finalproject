graph coloring

# MUST HAVE to networkx, numpy, and matlibplot to run
To install it Go to the File, Setting and packages and install the packages networkx, numpy, and matlibplot to run
NetworkX consists of Python package that allow us to create, manipulate, and study the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It enabled to generate classic graphs, random graphs, and synthetic networks. 

Numpy is an library in Python, which provides fast precompiled functions for mathematical and numerical routines,
makes it easier to handle large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Lastly, Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which provide the way to make the data visualization.  
plt.show() form the matplotlib allow us to display a figure by returning to the ipython prompt.

color trick for testing bipartite: graph is bipartite if no two adjacent verts have the same color

chromatic number Ï‡(G): minimum number of colors needed to color graph so no two adjacent verts have the same color
- number needed for a "proper coloring"

four color thm: chromatic number of a planer graph is no greater than 4

six color thm: chromatic number of a connected, planer simple graph is no greater than 6

this is way easier than solving chromatic polynomials
