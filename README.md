color trick for testing bipartite: graph is bipartite if no two adjacent verts have the same color

chromatic number Ï‡(G): minimum number of colors needed to color graph so no two adjacent verts have the same color
- number needed for a "proper coloring"

four color thm: chromatic number of a planer graph is no greater than 4

six color thm: chromatic number of a connected, planer simple graph is no greater than 6

this is way easier than solving chromatic polynomails
